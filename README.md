# Controllable_Costs
 The Controllable Costs Cube was developed in 2004, to provide an efficient means to analyze controllable costs for the development of financial requirements for preparation of Rate Applications to the British Columbia Utilities Commission and to allow Finance analysts to respond quickly and accurately to questions posed by BCUC in reference to rate applications. The cube is also used by others in the Finance area, where analysis of Controllable Costs is required for non-BCUC related purposes.  The Controllable Cost Cube allows the user to drill down on a given expense type, via a variety of business unit views and cost centre hierarchies, and to apply appropriate Basic/Optional and Non-Insurance percentages, as required. Multiple versions of cost data are maintained on the cube, allowing users to inquire about specific instances of cost data (such as Actuals, Plan, etc).
